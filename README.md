FamilySearch-Icons
==================

An icon pack used by FamilySearch.org, to be used in a FamilySearch supported open-source project called SumoApp.

This font pack was created by FamilySearch, but repurposed as a more global web font. It _may_ be permissable to use, but for now requesting permission of FamilySearch is suggested.
